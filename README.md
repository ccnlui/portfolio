# About This Project

This is a website made with React and React Router. It serves to be a portfolio to display projects I've made before. Hopefully, it will also show the growth and progress I've made as a software developer as I become better (:


### **Date**: 6/6/2019
### **Goal**: Learn how to use React to make a website!
### **What I Have Learned**:
A bunch of CSS and Javascript tricks to make a website look nice. Animation and transition are pretty fun and I wish I can spend more time getting better at it. React Router, Github Pages are also something I've picked up along the way.
