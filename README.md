# About This Project

This is a website made with React and React Router. It serves to be a portfolio to display projects I've made before. Hopefully, it will also show the growth and progress I've made as a software developer as I become better (:


### **Date**: 6/6/2019
### **Goal**: Learn how to use React to make a website!
### **What I Have Learned**:
A bunch of CSS and Javascript tricks to make a website look nice. Animation and transition are pretty fun and I wish I can spend more time getting better at it. React Router, Github Pages, Font Awesome Icons are also something I've picked up along the way. Difference between client-side and server-side routing and why it matters when using React Router.
### **Things To Work On**:
The way I implemented the typewriter effect is probably not optimal. I assumed render() to always use the latest state I update using setState() every 30ms. But React does not guarantee state to always be the most updated because setState() is async. Look more into animation in React before trying to fix this.

### **Reference**:
I've only borrowed ideas, everything in this project is coded by myself.
